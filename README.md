 Hi! 
 I'm Kelsi West. I'm a DIY enthusiast and that applies to all parts of my life, including my career as a Bioinformatics Scientist. 
 In my field, I find that communication and reproducibility is severely lacking. I want to help change this. 
 So here is my process of going through tutorials I find, making notes, finding errors, and trying to successfully recapitulate code or tutorials that are out there in the wild. 
 I deal with simple installations of software, to full-on analysis of complex datasets. 

 Let's make everything reproducbile. It starts with clear communication!
