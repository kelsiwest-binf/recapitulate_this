Biting the bullet and making my first post. 
Don't worry. No stories about my grandfather's first computer or whatever those home cook's like to talk about. 

I am trying to follow the tutorial found here: https://www.nextflow.io/blog/2021/setup-nextflow-on-windows.html

And just like that life got in the way. August was too busy for me. I also ended up upgrading to a new Macbook Pro. 
So we'll be continuning the tutorial with that. 

This will be a combination of setting up my Mac as a whole, for coding purposes and Nextflow install. 

#Specs
I have a MacBook M3 Pro, MacOS Sonoma v14.4. 


I started by installing Pycharm IDE Community Edition. It's my favorite IDE, but feel free to use your own. It helps me keep track of my local respoitories and scripts.
